# Welcome to `neural_structure`!

I didn't know how to call this, so here is `neural_structure`, my first shot at a neural network. I've tried multiple times but am finally trying again because I'm going to study this with a tutor around June 2023.

The neural network I'll be using will be written in Python, which is why I'm going with Python for this project (which is convenient as it's where I'm most confortable).

Most of this network (this early version at least) is heavily based on Sebastian Lague's video titled [How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c). Although it's written in **C#**, it's been extremely helping not only in writting the code but understanding what the hell is going on (it's almost a 1-to-1 copy as of today, 15-12-22).
